My office is Paterson Hall 406. Come visit, come as a group. Student hours are when I clear my calendar so I can chat with whoever drops by. You don't have to have anything specific you want to talk about, either. But if you do have a question, or something you'd like advice about, I'm around. You can ping me directly in Discord, too.
