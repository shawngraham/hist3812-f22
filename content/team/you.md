[You](you) are a student - maybe in your 3rd year, maybe not. You might be a History major, you might not. But what you certainly are is someone intrigued to think about how we might write history differently, how immersive media might enable us to tell better stories, more stories, and different stories, about the past. You're also curious about how immersive media impose certain kinds of constraints on what we do, making some kinds of stories more likely than others. You want to apply digital media to history... but you're not afraid to apply historical thinking to digital media.

You might be interested in the [Minor in Digital Humanities](https://carleton.ca/dighum/minor-in-digital-humanities/). Or maybe doing an [MA with a Specialization in Digital Humanities](https://carleton.ca/dighum/ma-specialization-in-digital-humanities-2/) in due course. (If you are, talk to Prof. Graham, by the way.)

You're certainly ready to open the black box of your computer, and make it work for you, for once!
