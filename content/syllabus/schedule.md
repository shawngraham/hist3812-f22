Before class on October 3rd, read [Interactive Fiction in the Humanities Classroom](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/interactive-text-games-using-twine), a Programming Historian tutorial by Gabi Kiriloff.

Take a paper that you have written elsewhere at Carleton that you really enjoyed and the material for which you know well. We will be considering how to express the argument of your paper via these two different platforms.

Your **Reflection** will include your thoughts on all of the work in this module; tie what you've read and heard  to what you've done. What is the main message of this module? How does it connect with your ideas for your Unessay? Your **Log** will be your record of your digital work in this module (including any Unessay work) - hiccups, successes, help found, help given. **Ephemera** is anything else you want to keep a record of, files created, screenshots, whatever.

> Upload your Reflection, Log, and Ephemera for Interstitial Work 1 to your Github Repository by the end of this week (Sunday night); **notify me** that you have done so using the form at [this link](#).

At this point, you should have made significant progress on your Unessays. During these two sessions, we will break into smaller groups where people who are working on similar projects can collaborate and help troubleshoot each other's work. We will work together December 5th on your Game Design Documents, while on December 7th we will consider your Paradata. Both are necessary for your final Unessay.

Your **Reflection** will include your thoughts on all of the work in this module; tie what you've read and heard  to what you've done. What is the main message of this module? How does it connect with your ideas for your Unessay?

# Take Home Exam

There is no take home exam in the sense of a bunch of questions to answer. But we'll say that there is; that way, you can submit your Unessay during the Examination period.

Submit by Dec 17 please.

> Upload all materials to your Github Repo or elsewhere as appropriate to the format of your Unessay, and notify me that you have done so using the form at [this link](#).
