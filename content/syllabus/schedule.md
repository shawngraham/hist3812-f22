The course is divided into three parts, with three interstitial weeks where we build things. We meet Mondays and Wednesdays 13.05-14.25 in TB 208. See below for further details. Mondays are generally days where I set the scene. Wednesdays require your active presence & participation as we try things.

### Term Dates

+ Sept 7 - Term begins
+ Sept 20 - Last day for registration & course changes **If you join the class late, please contact Prof. Graham**.
+ Oct 10 - Holiday
+ Oct 24 - 28 Fall break
+ Nov 11 - Last day for academic withdrawal with full fee adjustment
+ Dec 9 - End of term

# Module 1: Storytelling

+ Sept 7: **Praelude**. Introducing the course, its themes, and how everything works. Follow along [here](https://hist3812.netlify.app/slides/sept7.html)
  + [Complete this tutorial level before the Sept 12 meeting](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist3812-tutorial-level/src/)
  + OPTIONAL but strongly recommended: Download and install the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) thinking and note-taking environment; open that and explore the 'help' vault to get a sense of what's going on.
    + You can download this [course handbook](https://github.com/shawngraham/hist3812-f22/blob/main/static/obsidian/hist3812-obsidian-course-handbook.zip) as a vault (ie, folder) for Obsidian. Hit the download button, then unzip it somewhere sensible. Start obsidian or hit the 'open vault' button, and select the vault you just downloaded. It contains a number of useful plugins and templates. When it asks you if you trust the author of the notebook, say YES. Then hit the `x` to close the info box. 

An Obsidian-powered template for a 'game design document' based on one by Rosa Carbo-Mascarell can be found [here](https://github.com/shawngraham/obsidian-game-design-vault). You might wish to adapt this for your Unessay (not all parts will be useful, depending on what you do, and so should be modified as you wish.) 

Information about 'paradata' can be found [here, section 4.6](http://www.londoncharter.org/principles/documentation.html). Look over all the course materials and start thinking now about your unessay. More information is available on the [assessment](/syllabus/assessment) page.

# Interstitial 1

Oct 3 & Oct 5 - We will explore [Twine](https://twinery.org) and [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/) on these two dates. Twine runs in the browser. Have Ren'Py installed on a computer. If you don't have one, pair up with someone in the class who does. If access to a machine of some sort presents an obstacle, please let me know before this date and we'll figure out something together.

Before class on October 3rd, read [Interactive Fiction in the Humanities Classroom](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/interactive-text-games-using-twine), a Programming Historian tutorial by Gabi Kiriloff. I will also share with you some graduate work in history that revolves around making games ([Emslie's](https://hist3812.netlify.app/slides/Jenna_K_Emslie_MRE_in_PH_Sept2021.pdf) and [Cronkite's.](https://cuhistory.github.io/grads/items/hist_2.html))

Take a Wikipedia article for some historic event that captures your imagination. We'll storyboard and consider how to express the story via these two different platforms (taking into account what we've discussed in prior meetings).

Your **Reflection** will include your thoughts on all of the work in this module; tie what you've read and heard  to what you've done. What is the main message of this module? How does it connect with your ideas for your Unessay? Your **Log** will be your record of your digital work in this module (including any Unessay work) - hiccups, successes, help found, help given. **Ephemera** is anything else you want to keep a record of, files created, screenshots, whatever.

> Upload your Reflection, Log, and Ephemera for Interstitial Work 1 to your Github Repository by the end of this week (Sunday night); **notify me** that you have done so using the form at [this link](https://forms.gle/hFzXKvMku23AuY9XA).

# Interstitial 3

Dec 5 & Dec 7

At this point, you should have made significant progress on your Unessays. During these two sessions, we will break into smaller groups where people who are working on similar projects can collaborate and help troubleshoot each other's work. We will work together December 5th on your Game Design Documents, while on December 7th we will consider your Paradata. Both are necessary for your final Unessay.

Your **Reflection** will include your thoughts on all of the work in this module; tie what you've read and heard  to what you've done. What is the main message of this module? How does it connect with your ideas for your Unessay? Your **Log** will be your record of your digital work in this module (including any Unessay work) - hiccups, successes, help found, help given. **Ephemera** is anything else you want to keep a record of, files created, screenshots, whatever.

Dec 9th: This is a Friday, last one of the year and so follows a Monday schedule. We'll keep this date in reserve in case of interruptions or other necessities; I will let you know what is happening on this day as we get closer to it.

# Take Home Exam

There is no take home exam in the sense of a bunch of questions to answer. But we'll say that there is; that way, you can submit your Unessay during the Examination period.

Due December 22nd.

> Upload all materials to your Github Repo or elsewhere as appropriate to the format of your Unessay, and notify me that you have done so using the form at [this link](https://forms.gle/hFzXKvMku23AuY9XA).
