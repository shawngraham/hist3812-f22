We have a Discord server that you are welcome to use to coordinate any group work, to share materials, to plot and to scheme together.

You will get an invitation link the week of Sept 12 to join. If you want to join later, just let me know. **You are not obliged to use Discord**. But, you might find it helpful. I will hold office hours there (when I hold my on-campus hours) where you can use audio or video or text chat.

## Covid & Discord
In the event of a serious* Covid disruption, we will merely shift to a fully asynchronous mode using Discord. I promise you: no Zoom meetings. Instead, I will pull together materials for you to watch or read or do for each week, coordinated through channels for each Module of the course.

In the event of some sort of serious Covid disruption, I will ask that everyone uses Discord.

(*Serious: the University closing in-person classes)
