Everything we do here builds on what came before. Some things carry formal grades because that's the system we live in. Many things do not. Everything supports everything else.


According to section 2 of FASS Undergraduate Teaching Regulations and Procedures, this course outline constitutes a contract between you the student, and me, the professor. However, the word ‘syllabus’ (aka, the course outline), it seems is based on a misreading of a misprint of the greek word ‘sittybis’, meaning a **table of contents**. A table of contents is not a contract. Nevertheless, let us have a contract thus:

> I, Shawn Graham, agree to undertake to the best of my abilities, the task of challenging, guiding, and fostering in you, a deeper appreciation, awareness, and understanding for the ideas discussed in this class. You, for your part, agree to undertake the necessary intellectual work to meet me halfway, bringing your best abilities to bear, endeavouring to be receptive and prepared for all course-related activities. Together, we agree to create a community of learning and practice, such that true learning may occur.

+ in-class activities: Graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory. 'Unsatisfactory' will result in a penalty on the final unessay.
+ interstitial 1:10%
+ interstitial 2:20%
+ interstitial 3:30%
+ unessay:40%

## Criteria

- focus is on process, not necessarily the end product
- each interstitial exercise builds on the one previous
- interstitial materials coalesce into or support final unessay

## Unessay

The unessay is a creative engagement around a historical micro-episode.

	- should contain at least 30 minutes of immersive experience, broadly conceived
	- store it in a repo
	- obsidian vault (github repo?) containing all of the research notes
	- paradata that situates what the experience is trying to do: use the HPF (or adapt it) to the situation. This could be in the vault as well, and links to the relevant supporting materials
