Everything we do here builds on what came before. Some things carry formal grades because that's the system we live in. Many things do not. Everything supports everything else.

According to section 2 of FASS Undergraduate Teaching Regulations and Procedures, this course outline constitutes a contract between you the student, and me, the professor. However, the word ‘syllabus’ (aka, the course outline), it seems is based on a misreading of a misprint of the greek word ‘sittybis’, meaning a **table of contents**. A table of contents is not a contract. Nevertheless, let us have a contract thus:

> I, Professor Graham, agree to undertake to the best of my abilities, the task of challenging, guiding, and fostering in you, a deeper appreciation, awareness, and understanding for the ideas discussed in this class. You, for your part, agree to undertake the necessary intellectual work to meet me halfway, bringing your best abilities to bear, endeavouring to be receptive and prepared for all course-related activities. Together, we agree to create a community of learning and practice, such that true learning may occur.

# Grade Breakdown

+ in-class activities: satisfactory/unsatisfactory. These are normally on the second session in a given week. I am looking to see that you are participating in good faith. A habit of 'unsatisfactory' interactions will result in a conversation and perhaps, if necessary, penalty on the final unessay of 10%.
+ interstitial 1: 10%
+ interstitial 2: 20%
+ interstitial 3: 30%
+ unessay:  40%

## An Example Repo

An example github repository showing the structure to follow for your interestitials is [here](#). A similar repo showing the broad structure for your unessay is [here](#).

## Criteria for Interstitials
The focus of these interstitial exercises and your recording of your thinking is on the development of your process, on your evolution in the course.

> For each interstitial, you will create a separate repository in Github into which you will place your log.md, your reflection.md, and any other supporting files (screenshots, etc) as necessary.

_Guidance on using Github and getting it set up is available from my 'crafting digital history' course materials [here](https://craftingdh.netlify.app/tutorials/github/)._

_Guidance on using the conventions of markdown in a text file (eg a text file where you 'save as' with the .md file extension) to indicate titles, headers, links, bullets and so on is available [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet). If you'd like to practice markdown, [try Dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/)_

Points to ponder:
  - are things well documented? Could you pick up where you left off? (logs)
  - is there evidence of careful, reflexive thinking? Is there evidence of taking in the discussions, making connections between what you have done/heard/read? Explicitly cite materials that underpin your thinking using Harvard author-date contextual citations. (reflections)
  - is there evidence for how feedback has been considered, adopted, adapted? Is there evidence for a developing sophistication in the work?

Assessment will be along the spectrum “unsatisfactory - satisfactory - exceptional”. Numerically, this translates as:
+ unsatisfactory: 0-2 points (ie, F-D range)
+ satisfactory: 3-4 points (ie, C-B range)
+ exceptional: 5 points (ie, A-A+ range)

_Do not let ‘points’ distract you from the serious effort this course requires._

I will return feedback as soon as possible, usually within a week.

## Unessay

Your [unessay](https://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Teaching/the-unessay) is a creative engagement around a historical or archaeological micro-episode. Through your unessay, you will provide an answer to the [main questions of this course](goals). I expect that most of you will use a game engine/technology, although  other 'immersive' digital approaches are welcome. I am open to many suggestions; discuss with me sooner rather than later.

- It should contain at least 30 minutes of immersive experience, broadly conceived
- Its source code should be stored in a github repo (public or private; but if set to private, add 'shawngraham' as a collaborator)
- All of the research and process notes should be provided, showing the evolution of the project from initial concept through to submitted 'thing'. These can be text files in mardown format, in a subfolder of the repo.
- There should be a game design document (or similar).
- There should be a paradata document that situates what the experience is trying to do: use the HPS framework (or adapt it) to the situation.

An empty example Github repository with all of these elements is available [here](#).

The unessay will be assessed on how compelling and effective it is (following Paul Daniel O'Donnell):

> The main criterion is how well it all fits together. That is to say, how compelling and effective your work is.

>An unessay is compelling when it shows some combination of the following:
> + it is as interesting as its topic and approach allows
> + it is as complete as its topic and approach allows (it doesn’t leave the audience thinking that important points are being skipped over or ignored)
> + it is truthful (any questions, evidence, conclusions, or arguments you raise are honestly and accurately presented)

> In terms of presentation, an unessay is effective when it shows some combination of these attributes:
> + it is readable/watchable/listenable (i.e. the production values are appropriately high and the audience is not distracted by avoidable lapses in presentation)
> + it is appropriate (i.e. it uses a format and medium that suits its topic and approach)
> + it is attractive (i.e. it is presented in a way that leads the audience to trust the author and his or her arguments, examples, and conclusions).
