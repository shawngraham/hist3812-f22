_Epoiesen: A Journal for Creative Engagement in History and Archaeology_ ἐποίησεν (epoiesen)- made - is a journal for exploring creative engagement with the past, especially through digital means. It publishes primarily what might be thought of as ‘paradata’ or artist’s statements that accompany playful and unfamiliar forms of singing the past into existence.

Explore [_Epoiesen_](https://epoiesen.carleton.ca). What themes unite the pieces? How do different people interpret the idea of 'creative engagement'? Which ones seem most effective and _affective_ to you? Why is that? Are there any lessons for you as you approach the work for this course?

The Journal has published undergraduate work before (see [here](https://epoiesen.carleton.ca/2018/02/08/interactive-mapping-archae-victoria/) and [here](https://epoiesen.carleton.ca/2022/05/19/discovering-oneself/).) I hope that some of you might have work suitable for publication by the end of this course; your 'paradata' documents would play a key role in this. If this is something that interests you, talk to me when we get towards the end of the course.

I might also have some work available on the nuts-and-bolts side of things with regard to _Epoiesen_, in terms of web development and social media promotion. Talk to me.
