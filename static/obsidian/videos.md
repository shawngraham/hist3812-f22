## Some Videos re Various Techs


#### Obsidian 

**A quick introduction** to using Obsidian with the folder of files 'hist3812-obsidian-course-handbook'. In the jargon of Obsidian, such a folder is called a 'vault'. Key points: 

+ Obsidian is an interface for quickly writing notes using markdown
+ It makes connecting your ideas happen very fast: type `[[` to open the list of notes, select the one you want, hit return. 
+ As you create more notes, and notes begin to form natural connections, you start to develop your own personal knowledge base

**Connecting Hypothesis to Obsidian** is set up using the 'templater' command. Key points:
+ Use the **templates** (note the 'es') to insert simple templates
+ Use the **templater** (note the 'er') command to insert complex templates like hypothes.is import. 
+ Simple templates just reproduce headings, text; complex templates actually have code in them to do things.
+ The first time you run the hypothesis template, it will ask for your 'developer key' from Hypothesis. Log into your [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) account; under the cogwheel, select 'developer'. Copy the long string of letters and numbers. Paste that into the pop up box on Obsidian asking for your key. You only have to do this once.
