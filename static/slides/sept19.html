Consider... Ikea.

<aside class="notes"><p><a href="https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.library.carleton.ca/doi/pdf/10.1177/1206331208325599">https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.library.carleton.ca/doi/pdf/10.1177/1206331208325599</a></p>
<p>Ursula Lindqvist explores how Ikea is an &#39;archive&#39; in the original sense of the word - &#39;: the house where the superior magistrates lived, where the official documents were kept, and where those with the nomological agency to interpret the contents of those documents lived. Archive, then, engenders the idea of a house, a space that is both public and private and that signifies both political power and cultural authority.&#39;</p>
<p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s a museum - a museum to a constructed vision of swedish identity and like lindqvist says, a monument to a particular vision of a particular kind of democracy. It tells a story: and moving through the space of an Ikea you are forced to read it in particular ways. Keep this idea of forced pathways = a particular reading in mind. Further - an archive suggests that there are silences, acts of violence, things cast out that do not belong. In Ikea&#39;s case, it&#39;s Sweden&#39;s participation in transatlantic slave trade and eugenics, and its own founder&#39;s family&#39;s history.</p>

so... keeping in mind how we move through sites of memory:

what was a standout experience for you, in terms of museum or public history?

what was a standout _digital_ experience for you, in terms of museum or public history?

What unites these two experiences?

Movement & Enchantment

<aside class="notes"><p>picture of something mysterious</p>
<p>how do we read the landscape? through movement. how does movement create moments for enchantment? by encounters with the eruptions of deep time into the present, by the uncanny, by the emotional, by the emergent</p>
<p>enchantment as a mood;  disenchantment is where the enlightenment, modernism gets us: emotional detachment from the world. it produces alienation. Jane Bennet on the other hand argues for enchantment, a rediscovery of wonder, as something that would propel ethical engagement with the world. per bennet, enchantment is to be &#39;struck and shaken by the extraordinary that lives amid the everyday&#39;. To find enchantment, we need to playfully reconfigure things to be alive to chance operations: ties into complexity theory, emergence.</p>

Ok, fair enough, right? The question then becomes: how do digital technologies complicate this, and where might we find enchantment in this?

<aside class="notes"><p>&#39;The most widely implemented and traditional of these types is the <em>passive linear nodal narrative</em> structure, while <em>active multilinear, nodal networks</em> and <em>emergent narratives</em> are less widely implemented. This article seeks to analyse what kind of engagement a variety of narrative structures facilitate in heritage spaces; how these narrative forms shape the relationship between the creator, media and consumer; and how digital media and interactive technology affordances are being leveraged within this design.&#39;

<aside class="notes"><p>an example of the emergent narrative. copplestone &amp; dunne write of their digital media performance piece &#39;clifford&#39;s tower&#39;, that used emergent features in a one-off performance &#39;the narrative progression in any given run of <em>Clifford&#39;s Tower: Voices</em> is entwined with the audience (past and present)&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;the digital system that interfaced between the performers, the visualisation and the application used by the audience, was designed to log and map responses (both other audience perspectives and statements from expert sources). To this end each narrative pathway generated by the system would be informed by the links and networks that related interpretations, comments, artefacts and data. This system-generated narrative could create pathways, for example, that pulled all the different audience ideas about how it might have felt to inhabit the Tower during the 13th century, and align those against database images, reconstructions or a variety of expert interpretations - allowing a space for multivocality and discussion to manifest.&quot;</p>

The point: 

"certain media forms facilitate or prohibit certain narrative structures, but change in the media form does not directly correlate to change in narrative structure itself"

<aside class="notes"><p>point is to get them to think about the actual structure of the experience, not the gee-whiz tech; so many &#39;digital&#39; implementations of storytelling are just souped-up treasure hunts overlaid on the more fundamental storytelling experience - which is achieved through movement.</p>
<ul>
<li>passive linear progression: good for &#39;authority&#39;, keeping the &#39;teller&#39; in a position of power (think again about Ikea...</li>
<li>&#39;active nodal networks&#39;: &quot;the nodal network structure is incredibly effective for telling collages of information that are loosely linked, but not necessarily contingent or affective to each other. In other words, it is a structure which can tell <em>many</em> stories about the past as a collage of discrete events, yet it struggles to demonstrate processes, relationships or connections within or between narrative sections&quot;. &quot;it highlights a popular practice in wider heritage implementations of digital media and digital creativity – that digital media is often used to render existing structures, ideas and practices&quot;</li>
</ul>

The point part 2: 

multivocality and reflexive engagement emerge _through replay_. We move from **the** story to **a** story to many **stories**
