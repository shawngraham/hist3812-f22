- the student's remix of the newsreel: was this good history?

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li><p>guy in class felt the music was too triumphal, stank of same propaganda as nazis</p>
</li>
<li><p>he remixed it with requiem by mozart; felt it was &#39;truer&#39;</p>
</li>
<li><p>students eventually felt the original was good if doing history, but the remix better for <em>teaching</em> history

Transmedia Storytelling - Henry Jenkins, 2006
- cultural attractors
- cultural activators

<aside class="notes"><p>at the heart of Jenkin&#39;s concept of transmedia is the distinction between cultural attractors or works that draw like minded individuals together to form a community and cultural activators or works that give these communities something to do </p>
<ul>
<li>in museums, you get &#39;immersive multimedia experiences&#39;, but they often have trouble with getting the story aspect to work - they don&#39;t take idea of attractors and activators into account</li>
<li>one of the most powerful uses of transmedia storytelling was the fashion for alternate reality games in early 00s.</li>
<li>the key conceit of ARGS was another layer of reality that bled into our everyday reality; the invocation &#39;this is not a game&#39; was a signal that yes, yes it is!</li>

<li>these all required teams of designers and runners, and explicitly invoked magic circles! </li>
<li>kinda fallen out of fashion; unfortunately, life took on too many elements of ARGs - the idea that there was a magic circle dissolved because conditioned to disbelieve the &#39;other guys&#39;, to demonstrate loyalty to one side by explicitly denying reality. the stronger the reaction, the more obviously &#39;good&#39; it must be.</li>

“My name is Sophia,” it began. “I got your name off the UWO History website, and I was hoping you or your friends could help me.”

<aside class="notes"><p>In September 2011, in the first week of the new school year, about two dozen students in and around the Public History program at the University of Western Ontario received an unusual email. “My name is Sophia,” it began. “I got your name off the UWO History website, and I was hoping you or your friends could help me.” Most of the students deleted the email without a second thought, but a few followed the attached link to an even more unusual video. The video showed a man, dressed in a Napoleonic-era uniform, apparently locked in a small room. The man, identified only as Captain Smith, seemed to have no memory of how he got there, or indeed of any historical events from the last two hundred years. But he, too, asked for help</p>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li><p>clues led to another website, then the university library, and in books about war of 1812 <em>that had never been signed out</em> they found scraps of paper with cryptic notes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>they uncovered a conspiracy, had to run around the city of London, graveyards, and uncover the central mystery: what happened to Shawnee war chief Tecumseh&#39;s body? (he died at the Battle of the Thames on Oct 5 1813.) - the stories that emerged afterwards speak to political and social concerns of the day. Tecumseh Lies Here &lt;- a dark pun.</p>
</li>
<li><p>took 4 months of planning, 1 month to run it; how replayable is something like this?</p>
</li>
<li><p>it took 7 people working day and night for a month to keep the game being played by 20 people (another dozen casual) going, making new content, fixing things, rushing to keep one step ahead of the players</p>
</li>
<li><p>compelling aspect: no obvious rules, directions, or parameters; leads to sense of immersion, paranoia!</p>
</li>
<li><p>final part of the game was a puzzle box that would only open if the players took it to the correct location - which happened to be in the middle of a living history museum during a reanctor&#39;s weekend.</p>

threshold concepts: core ideas that transform perception of a subject

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li><p>later iterations of Tecumseh Lies Here - goal was to teach history through <em>doing</em> history; in the context of the raw raw canada 1812 celebrations, nuanced discussions of Indigenous role in the fight, their betrayal etc etc not being discussed. they were fighting against the &#39;banal nationalism&#39; of the 1812 celebrations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>they tried to create a D&amp;D like version; ballooned to 30 000 words, never released.</p>
</li>
<li><p>they wanted to keep the idea that you learn history by doing history, so they identified 3 threshold concepts that they&#39;d design around. </p>
</li>
<li><p>in this case,
1 historians are detectives. 2 history is a conversation. 3 history itself has a history.</p>
</li>
<li><p>created an &#39;untextbook&#39; for middle school teachers to use. They made it look like the research notes of one of the paranoid conspiracy people from the alternate reality game; Captain Smith would appear talk them through key ideas; secret videos could be discovered, where Captain Smith would whisper, &#39;Someone is being left out of the history, your teacher isn&#39;t telling you everyting&#39; which&#39;d lead to secret links to missing pages of the untextbook.</p>

Tecumseh Lies Here & the untextbook were both very successful, but not very sustainable or scalable.
