#### HIST 3812
Sept 7 w/ Dr. Graham

<div align="right">
There is a vast <br>conspiracy in the world.

You know who is involved -  confess. <br>Names out of history: who?

note: play aliens & vampires. now - what was good history here? what made this fun? where was the history?

</div>

---

History is important. Serious.
<br>But what if it was also... playful?

---

<!-- slide bg="timetravelhistorian.webp"  data-background-opacity="0.5" -->

Time Travel.

note: 
- am interested in playful engagements with the past because of disenchantment ('objective') vs enchantment ('subjective')
- because the world is on fire and 'eat your broccoli' isn't working

I wrote a book. You don't have to buy it. But this class emerges from that process of writing.

note: entry of the uncanny into the world. qs I had when writing, my own progression.

<div align="right">

**How do we write ‘good history’ through playful engagements? What does ‘good history’ look like, how is it constructed, and what happens when it meets digital technologies?**

</div>

note: ask 'em this, see what we come up with.

---

We'll use various immersive technologies

(here's a small [list of tools](https://hist3812.netlify.app/syllabus/tools/))

---

## end goal

- create your own immersive, playful history
	- can use video game techs (actual games: ok!)
	- can use AR/XR/VR techs (eg [locative stuff](http://picturinglebretonflats.ca/))
	- playful renderings (generative art, [sound](http://songsoftheottawa.ca/),  etc)
	- low tech: board, card game - maybe.
	- functional is a bonus
- via a [design document](https://github.com/shawngraham/obsidian-game-design-vault)

note: 
	show them the obsidian gdd?
	tech element: is in the planning, laying out

# The point 

<split even gap="3">

You'll need to think about process, paradata, design.

You'll need to think about the  _why_ at all times.

Experiments are OK. Encouraged, even!

---

<!-- slide bg="bluebricks.png" data-background-opacity="0.5"  -->

Your unessay should answer the big ticket question of the class. 

Maybe not _the_ definitive answer, but... _an_ answer!

I don't care if tech breaks.

I care that you [try](https://hist3812.netlify.app/syllabus/assessment/).
</div>

note:
# Fails?

I wrote a whole g*d'd book on [Failing Gloriously](https://thedigitalpress.org/failing-gloriously/).

There are no fails. There are only experiments. 

IF AND ONLY IF you document your process, paradata, and thinking.

Logic of Git & Github

- repos can be 'private' but add user ```shawngraham``` as collaborator

# COVID

It's going to happen.

I'll **always** be masked. If we truly believe in making university accessible for everyone, you should too: we protect the vulnerable, together.
---

The plan for when/if you get sick:

## I trust you.

I do not need or want to see dr's notes.

If something is up, just email me with 'something's up' in the subject line. 

I **do not** need to know the details.

We can roll with pretty much anything and will find a solution.

---

The plan for when/if I get sick:

- Your TA will communicate with you things that you can read to help as you build your unessays

---

The plan for when/if we all shift back to online:

- discord for fully asynchronous work (screw zoom)
- collaboration is **always** welcome, no matter the circumstances: simply acknowledge it
- I will cook up detailed instructions & short help videos

---

## By next class:

+ Complete the tutorial level - including the tasks you'll discover within it.
	+ I will know if you have ;)
+ Download and install Obsidian
+ Explore the course website & schedule fully
	+ use hypothesis to annotate the site with any comments/questions, in the 3812 reading group ([join here https://hypothes.is/groups/MP67BLk7/hist3812](https://hypothes.is/groups/MP67BLk7/hist3812)
	+ _or_ send any questions to me; I will collate & answer them.
