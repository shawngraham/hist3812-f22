Jeremiah McCall:

Curation implies a choice. What guides that choice?

<aside class="notes"><p>a choice always implies a theoretical point of view, a means through which a choice is made, options evaluated: which things are deemed worthy of attention</p>
<p>McCall goes on to talk about Kapell &amp; Elliott&#39;s volume of collected essays on games:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kapell and Elliott rightly indicate are the most interesting questions of historical game studies, not whether &quot;a given product deviates from the historical record, but rather for what reason it does so and what effect this might have&quot; (Kapell &amp; Elliott, 2013, p.8)</p>

For McCall, games are systems

Complex Systems? Or merely complicated systems?

<aside class="notes"><p>&#39;a functioning game must be a closed working set of formally -- that is mathematically -- defined systems needing player input to function. It is a historical medium different from a book, lecture, morality tale, painting or film. It is decidedly not a historical monograph, nor do its consumers wish it to be&#39;. he says we have to understand them both as systems, and as models.</p>

<p>To borrow an example from <a href="https://gamingthepast.net/2021/01/24/through-the-darkest-of-times-historical-problem-space/">McCall’s blog post</a> on <em>Through the Darkest of Times</em>: one could critique the lack of representation of other political parties in the game’s depiction of 1930s Germany, but this critique would be incomplete without considering how political parties function as an element in the game world.

> **Historically Meaningful Game Design**. Our guiding principle is that every element of the game should be considered in light of how historically _meaningful_ it is and how much it contributes to our prioritised historical discourses.
- from dream of darkness devlog may 2022  

<aside class="notes"><p>remember the difference between discourse and story? another element to consider. </p>
<p>they go on to say &gt; accuracy can be useful, but it’s even more important to mount an argument with our research and our accurate recreations. A fact is great, but unless it tells us something important, it’s not being put to its best use in our game. (This concept also allows us to create historical arguments with fantasy/supernatural elements and invention – a topic for next time, perhaps!)</p>

[Imperial Design](https://medium.com/@betterthemask/game-design-in-the-imperial-mode-cgsa-2022-e5a9a6a57859)

- the material constraints of designing games in a game industry

<aside class="notes"><p>this goes beyond what mccall called the meta level, the genre conventions. This is arguing that the material conditions of the labour of video game making is such that alternatives <em>can&#39;t even be attempted</em> because games must make money. Obviously, we&#39;re talking industry here; but maybe there are similar issues at play on the indie side of things? If you, the student, engage with this idea, I want to see citations to support your thought; your opinion based as a player of games is not sufficient.</p>

> What games are now is also a result of all the games that didn’t get made, work which has been suppressed and forgotten, and the shadow of all the potential work unmade by people — particularly women & marginalised people — who have quite frankly been persecuted out of the games industry.

<p>Player-centric design” is plagued by unexamined whiteness, and I believe that our reluctance as an industry to believe that players can enjoy experiences of unfairness, exclusion, limitation, powerlessness — or even just types of power outside of domination — is rooted in our internalisation of the white player. The anxiousness to “give the player what he wants”, in the sense of the ritual mantra “the customer is always right”, often runs counter to a game’s ludonarrative intentions, causing dissonance and distortion</p>

Thus, HPS can be used to describe the game-as-system, but under 'genre', which constrains so much, we have to understand the material conditions of how games are produced, and the history of the creation of the 'ideal player'.
