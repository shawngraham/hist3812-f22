Q: What happens when you teach students how to lie?  
A: They learn how to be historians. _Mills Kelly_

<aside class="notes"><p>&#39;Given that historians care a great deal about historical methods and that history majors are presumably interested in the methods of their chosen discipline, how is it that the methods course could have become an apparent nexus for so much dissatisfaction from both faculty and students? After thinking about this problem for quite a while, I decided that there are two very likely answers to the problems I and others find with this course. The first possible answer is that when it comes to teaching historical methods historians have lost their sense of fun, their sense of playfulness when it comes to our discipline (assuming we ever had such a sense of fun in the first place). The second possible answer is that in the increasingly intermediated world our students now live in, the traditional approaches to historical methods—in fact the traditional approaches to history itself—are increasingly disconnected from the lives our students live&#39;</p>

How are hoaxes like poems?


<aside class="notes"><p>Kavanaugh, 197 Our objectivity is more limited than we tend to pretend, however hard we try. The more closely we position ourselves to empiricism, the more closely we move to the simple reporting of lists (measurements, artefacts, dates, lists of lists) and the further we get from communicating their significance. This is where poetry may help. Like prose, it can communicate propositional knowledge (‘knowing that’, as opposed to non-propositional knowledge, ‘knowing how’). That is, poetry can offer us truths or facts about the world. What it can also do, is to offer phenomenal knowledge (Broad 1925; Feigl 1958; Nagel 1974), an insight into the possible experience attending those lists, which includes the phenomenological and emotional content that archaeological physicalism denies. With the addition of fictive utterances, such as an imaginary narrator, it is able to suggest, or  even  reveal,  conceptual  edges  to  our  thinking.  This  then  facilitates  an  extension to our epistemic comprehension.</p>

What does poetry do?

<aside class="notes"><p>Kavanaugh- I take the distinction between fact and fiction to be that the former is referential (to reality) and the latter is not. That is, fiction is something invented and, as such, it is therefore today often imbued “with a degree of covert negativity and  frivolity”  (ibid.:  3)  because  invented  or  conceptual  things  are  weighted  with a lighter degree of truth value than that of a tangible or material thing.Poetry bridges these divides. It can be a fiction in that it is always con-ceptual, whilst also being referential. Likewise, it can be total make-believe.</p>

Critical Fabulation /2

<small>
<split even gap="3">
"So is it possible to reiterate her name and to tell a story about degraded matter and dishonored life that doesn’t delight and titillate, but instead ventures toward another mode of writing? 

"If it is no longer suffcient to expose the scandal, then how might it be possible to generate   a different set of descriptions from this archive? To imagine what could have been? To  envision a free state from this order of statements? ""

"The dangers entailed in this endeavor  cannot be bracketed or avoided because of the inevitability of the reproduction of such  scenes of violence, which define the state of blackness and the life of the ex-slave. To  the contrary, these dangers are situated at the heart of my work, both in the stories I have chosen to tell and in those that I have avoided."

Saidiya V Hartman - Venus in Two Acts, 2008
[original version](https://watermark-silverchair-com.proxy.library.carleton.ca/2-sa26%20hartman%20(1-14).pdf)|[zine version](https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/learn/venus-in-two-acts-cassandra.pdf?_ga=2.185249322.280157182.1660248359-107634124.1660248359)

The archive is inseparable from the play of power that murdered Venus and her shipmate and exonerated the captain. And this knowledge brings us no closer to an understanding of the lives of two captive girls or the violence that destroyed them and named the ruin: Venus. Nor can it explain why at this late date we still want to write stories about them...

...By advancing a  series of speculative arguments and exploiting the capacities of the subjunctive (a grammatical mood that expresses doubts, wishes, and possibilities), in fashioning a narrative, which is based upon archival research, and by that I mean a critical reading of the archive that mimes the figurative dimensions of history, I intended both to tell an impossible story and to amplify the impossibility of its telling.

Fabula & the subjunctive tense
- playing, rearranging the elements of the story & sequence to create divergent, contested views
- makes visible the construction of the past
- 'narrative restraint', refusal to fill gaps or provide closure an imperative of the method
- point is not to 'give voice' but imagine what cannot be said
- "It is a history of an unrecoverable past; it is a narrative of what might have been or could have been; it is a history written with and against the archive."

<aside class="notes"><p>Hartman: The method guiding this writing practice is best described as critical fabulation. “Fabula” denotes the basic elements of story, the building blocks of the narrative. A fabula, according to Mieke Bal, is “a series of logically and chronologically related events that are caused and experienced by actors. An event is a transition from one state to another. Actors are agents that perform actions. (They are not necessarily human.) To act is to cause or experience and event.” 35</p>
